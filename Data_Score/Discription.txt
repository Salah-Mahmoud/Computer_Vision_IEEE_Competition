
Description
Welcome to the Microscopic Image Classification Challenge: Unlocking the Hidden World! This competition invites you to delve into the fascinating realm of image classification. With a rich dataset consisting of diverse microscopic images, your mission is to develop cutting-edge classification models that can accurately identify and categorize various microscopic specimens.

NOTE THAT:
Given the diverse nature of the microscopic images and their sources, participants will need to proficiently merge training data folders to create comprehensive models capable of making classifications.
